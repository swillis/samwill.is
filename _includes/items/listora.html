			In my 3+ years working with Listora (and it's many other incarnations) we strived to build software that helped event organisers promote their events.

			Listora was a turbulent but fascinating first experience in the startup world for me. We went through so many different stages of ideation, reincarnation and desperation while trying to get product market fit. As a junor designer I couldn't have hoped for a better place (or bunch of people for that matter) to learn and grow as fast as you need to at that stage in your career.
