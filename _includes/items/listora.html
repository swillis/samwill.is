			In my 3+ years working with Listora (and its many other incarnations) we strived to build software that helped event organisers promote their events.
		</p>
		<p>
			Listora was a turbulent but fascinating first experience in the startup world for me. We went through so many different stages of ideation, reincarnation and desperation while trying to get product market fit. As a junior designer I couldn't have hoped for a better place, or bunch of people, to learn with and grow as fast as I needed to at that stage of my career.
